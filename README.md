# `go test -coverpkg` does not work how I think

The code in `foo` is 100% covered by the test in `foo/foo_test.go`. The code in `bar` is 100% covered by the test in `intn/integration_test.go`.

I canâ€™t seem to find a way to run _all_ the tests, and get coverage results saying that both `foo` and `bar` have 100% coverage.

```
